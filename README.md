### Git Large File Storage
[git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) should be used to store big files.
Please follow [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) to set up git-lfs on your end.
As of now the following paths are tracked with git-lfs:
- `data/*/*.zip`
- `data/*/*.csv`
- `data/*/*.xlsx`
- `notebooks/*.ipynb`

If you need to track different paths, please add them using `git lfs track [path-to-be-tracked]`.
This will append new lines to `.gitattributes` file.
